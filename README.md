Correlation between survival rate & Age
The scatter chart gives the rate of survival against age. The degree to which the points fall on the line indicate the strength of the correlation.

Higher Survival for Females: Females generally had higher survival rates across all classes compared to males.
Class Impact: First-class passengers had the highest survival rates, with a noticeable drop in survival rates for second and third-class passengers, especially for males.
Gender Disparity: The survival rate disparity between genders is more pronounced in lower classes, with males in third class having the lowest survival rates.

THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
Survival Rate by Point of Embarkation
Chart of survival percentage by embarkation point. The size shows the sum of the fares. The vertical position shows the survival rate.

{NOTE:
Higher Survival Rate from Cherbourg: This could be due to a higher proportion of first-class passengers boarding at Cherbourg, who had better access to lifeboats.
Lower Survival Rates from Queenstown and Southampton: These embarkation points might have had more third-class passengers, who faced more challenges in reaching lifeboats.}
![Screenshot (23)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f997ee3d-1714-4754-8d42-b95b6ccdc6ac)
Cherbourg ©: Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg have the highest survival rate, estimated to be around 55-60%.
Queenstown (Q): The survival rate for passengers from Queenstown is the lowest, approximately 35-40%.
Southampton (S): Passengers from Southampton have a survival rate of about 35-40%, similar to Queenstown.

10.
THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
First Class:
Females: 96.8% survival rate.
Males: 3.2% survival rate.
Insight: Females in first class had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
Second Class:
Females: 92.1% survival rate.
Males: 7.9% survival rate.
Insight: Similar to first class, females in second class also had a much higher survival rate than males.
Third Class:
Females: 50% survival rate.
Males: 50% survival rate.
Insight: In third class, the survival rates for males and females were equal, indicating no gender-based survival advantage
![Screenshot (21)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87a4211a-ebd6-4794-8d90-48bbb91810f7)
Higher Survival Rates for Females: In both first and second classes, females had significantly higher survival rates compared to males.
Equal Survival Rates in Third Class: The third class shows an equal survival rate for both genders, suggesting that class played a more critical role in survival than gender in this category.

THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
This graph is a scatter plot with a linear regression line, showing the relationship between the average fare paid by passengers (x-axis) and their survival status (y-axis) on the Titanic. The data points are represented by red circles and green triangles, indicating different categories, possibly gender or class.


Red Circles: These data points might represent one category (e.g., males or third-class passengers).
Green Triangles: These data points might represent another category (e.g., females or first-class passengers).
Linear Regression Line: The trend line shows the general relationship between fare and survival. A positive slope indicates that higher fares are associated with higher survival rates.

Higher Fares, Higher Survival: Passengers who paid higher fares generally had a higher chance of survival, as indicated by the upward trend of the regression line.
Category Differences: The separation of data points into red circles and green triangles suggests that different categories (e.g., gender or class) had different survival rates, with one category (green triangles) showing a stronger positive correlation between fare and survival.

 12.
 THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS

This graph is a bar graph titled “Cabin wise Survived Died,” showing the number of Titanic passengers who survived and died, categorized by their cabin class.
Survived (Left Bar): This bar is divided into segments representing different cabin classes. The colors indicate the proportion of survivors from each class.
Died (Right Bar): Similarly, this bar shows the number of passengers who did not survive, categorized by cabin class.
![Screenshot (25)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8894e7e-969a-4a27-9834-502b94d4bcfc)
No Cabin Assigned: A significant portion of both survivors and deceased passengers had no cabin assigned, indicating they were likely in third class or steerage.
Higher Survival in Certain Cabins: Passengers in higher cabin classes (A, B, C) had higher survival rates compared to those in lower classes (D, E, F, G).
Class Disparity: The graph highlights a stark difference in survival rates based on cabin class, with higher-class passengers having better survival chances.
