THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS 
1st Class: Passengers who survived paid an average fare of $95.61, while those who did not survive paid $64.68.
2nd Class: Survived passengers paid an average fare of $22.06, and those who did not survive paid $19.41.
3rd Class: The average fare for both survived and non-survived passengers is almost the same, around $13.67 and $13.69 respectively

THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
THE distributed within the population, highlighting that the 25-44 age group has the highest percentage, while the <5 age group has the lowest

THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
This chart shows the total number of passengers in blue and the number of survivors in orange based on class and gender. The difference between the blue bar and the orange bar is the number of people who lost their lives aboard the Titanic. The percentage that survived is shown above each bar

THE NO OF MALE PASSANGERS SURVIVED BASED ON AGE
{THE AGE GROUP OF 30 HAD THE HIGHEST SURVIVERS WITH 21% }

THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
The scatter chart gives the rate of survival against fare. The degree to which the points fall on the line indicate the strength of the correlation.

This graph helps visualize the relationship between fare and survival, highlighting that higher fares are associated with a higher likelihood of survival

10.
THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
Correlation between survival rate & Age
The scatter chart gives the rate of survival against age. The degree to which the points fall on the line indicate the strength of the correlation.
