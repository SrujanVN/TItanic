THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS 
1st Class: Passengers who survived paid an average fare of $95.61, while those who did not survive paid $64.68.
2nd Class: Survived passengers paid an average fare of $22.06, and those who did not survive paid $19.41.
3rd Class: The average fare for both survived and non-survived passengers is almost the same, around $13.67 and $13.69 respectively

THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
THE distributed within the population, highlighting that the 25-44 age group has the highest percentage, while the <5 age group has the lowest

THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
This chart shows the total number of passengers in blue and the number of survivors in orange based on class and gender. The difference between the blue bar and the orange bar is the number of people who lost their lives aboard the Titanic. The percentage that survived is shown above each bar

THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
The scatter chart gives the rate of survival against fare. The degree to which the points fall on the line indicate the strength of the correlation.

This graph helps visualize the relationship between fare and survival, highlighting that higher fares are associated with a higher likelihood of survival

THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
Correlation between survival rate & Age
The scatter chart gives the rate of survival against age. The degree to which the points fall on the line indicate the strength of the correlation.

THIS PART OF THE CODE GIVES THE SUMMARY BY PLOTTING A BAR GRAPH THAT SAYS
Survival Rate by Point of Embarkation
Chart of survival percentage by embarkation point. The size shows the sum of the fares. The vertical position shows the survival rate.
NOTE:
Higher Survival Rate from Cherbourg: This could be due to a higher proportion of first-class passengers boarding at Cherbourg, who had better access to lifeboats.
Lower Survival Rates from Queenstown and Southampton: These embarkation points might have had more third-class passengers, who faced more challenges in reaching lifeboats.

Cherbourg Â©: Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg have the highest survival rate, estimated to be around 55-60%.
Queenstown (Q): The survival rate for passengers from Queenstown is the lowest, approximately 35-40%.
Southampton (S): Passengers from Southampton have a survival rate of about 35-40%, similar to Queenstown.
